<p>The first step is collecting the dataset. If a requisite expert is available, then s/he could suggest which fields (attributes, features) are the most informative. If not, then the simplest method is that of “brute-force,” which means measuring everything available in the hope that the right (informative, relevant) features can be isolated. However, a dataset collected by the “brute-force” method is not directly suitable for induction. It contains in most cases noise and missing feature values, and therefore requires significant pre-processing (Zhang et al., 2002).</p>
